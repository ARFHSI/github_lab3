    I have always wondered whats the worth of a soul, is it what it achieves in its mortal form, or what it feels <br>
    in its supernatural existence? regardless of how we value the soul, each soul has value, and the objective way <br>
    to judge it doesnt exist, its all subjective, so judge your soul the way you see fit, but dont apply your judgement <br>
    to others
